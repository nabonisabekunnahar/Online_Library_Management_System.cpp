# Online Library Management
This is a simple command-line implementation of an Online Library Management System using C++. It allows librarians to add and remove books from the library, as well as display all the books in the library. Students can borrow books from the library and return them.

# Librarian Menu:

Add a book: Librarians can add a new book to the library by entering the title, author, ID, and availability of the book.

Remove a book: Librarians can remove a book from the library by specifying the ID of the book to be removed.

Display all books: Librarians can view all the books available in the library.


# Student Menu:

Borrow a book: Students can borrow a book from the library by entering the ID of the book they wish to borrow. If the book is available, it will be marked as borrowed.

Return a book: Students can return a borrowed book to the library by entering the ID of the book they want to return. If the book is not already available, it will be marked as returned.



# Usage:
Compile and run the C++ code in any C++ compiler.
The program will display a menu with options for librarians and students.
Choose the appropriate menu option and follow the instructions to perform the desired action.
Repeat steps 2-3 until you choose to exit the program.



# File Management:
The program uses a text file (books.txt) to store the information about books in the library. The file is created in the same directory as the program and is used to persist book data between program runs.
